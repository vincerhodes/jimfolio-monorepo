## Post-War Economic History (1945-1971)

### The Bretton Woods System

**Key Facts**:
- Established July 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire
- 44 Allied nations agreed to fixed exchange rates
- US dollar pegged to gold at $35/ounce
- Other currencies pegged to dollar
- Created IMF and World Bank
- Lasted until August 15, 1971

**Why It Mattered**:
The Bretton Woods system created monetary stability that enabled the post-war economic boom. By tying currencies to gold, it limited the ability of governments to create unlimited money, preventing inflation and speculation.

**Example Prose**:
```
In July 1944, while World War II still raged, representatives from 44 nations 
gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Their 
mission: prevent another Great Depression.

The system they created was elegant in its simplicity. The US dollar would be 
convertible to gold at $35 per ounce. Every other currency would be pegged to 
the dollar. This created a stable, predictable international monetary system.

For nearly three decades, it worked. Currencies were stable. Trade flourished. 
Speculation was limited. Money was tied to something real.

This wasn't just technical monetary policy. It was the foundation for shared 
prosperity.
```

### The Golden Age of Capitalism (1945-1973)

**Key Statistics**:
- UK GDP growth: Average 2.9% annually (1950-1973)
- Real wages grew ~2.5% annually
- Productivity grew ~2.8% annually
- Unemployment: Average 1.8% (1950-1970)
- Inflation: Average 4.6% (manageable and predictable)

**Income Distribution**:
- Top 1% income share (UK): ~6-7% (1950s-1970s)
- Top 10% income share (UK): ~28-30%
- Gini coefficient: ~0.25 (relatively equal)

**Tax Rates**:
- UK top marginal rate: 83-98% (1950s-1970s)
- Corporate tax rate: 52.5% (1965)
- Capital gains tax: Introduced 1965 at 30%

**Housing**:
- Average house price to income ratio: 3.5x (1970)
- Homeownership rate: 50% (1970), rising
- Council housing: 31% of all homes (1979)

**Union Power**:
- Union membership: 13.2 million (1979 peak)
- Union density: 55% of workforce (1979)
- Collective bargaining coverage: ~70%

**Example Prose**:
```
Between 1950 and 1973, something remarkable happened in Britain and across 
the developed world. Economists call it the "Golden Age of Capitalism." 
Workers called it a fair deal.

The economy grew at nearly 3% per year. But unlike today, that growth was 
shared. When productivity increased, wages increased. When companies made 
more profit, workers earned more too.

A factory worker could buy a house. A teacher could support a family on a 
single salary. University was free. The NHS was born and thriving.

This wasn't luck. It was policy.

Top tax rates reached 83%. Strong unions gave workers bargaining power. 
Housing was treated as a right, not an investment. The government built 
homes—millions of them.

The message was clear: extreme wealth concentration wouldn't be tolerated. 
Prosperity would be shared.

## The Turning Point (1971-1990)

### Nixon Ends Gold Standard (August 15, 1971)

**What Happened**:
- Nixon announced suspension of dollar-gold convertibility
- Called "Nixon Shock"
- Ended Bretton Woods system
- Ushered in era of fiat currency

**Immediate Effects**:
- Dollar devalued ~10% against major currencies
- Gold price soared from $35 to $800+ by 1980
- Inflation accelerated
- Exchange rate volatility increased

**Long-term Implications**:
- Removed constraint on money creation
- Enabled modern monetary policy (QE)
- Shifted power to central banks
- Disconnected money from physical limits

**Example Prose**:
```
On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon appeared on television with an 
announcement that would reshape the global economy.

"I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility 
of the dollar into gold."

Temporarily. It's been 53 years.

For 27 years, the dollar had been backed by gold. You could, in theory, 
exchange $35 for an ounce of gold. This limited how much money could exist—
it had to be backed by something real.

When Nixon severed that link, money became... abstract. A number in a computer. 
A promise backed only by government authority.

This wasn't necessarily bad. It gave governments flexibility to respond to 
crises. But it required new rules, new safeguards to prevent abuse.

Instead, we got deregulation.

### Thatcher and Reagan Revolution (1979-1990)

**Key Policies**:

**UK (Thatcher, 1979-1990)**:
- Top income tax cut from 83% to 40% (1988)
- Corporate tax cut from 52% to 35%
- Financial deregulation ("Big Bang" 1986)
- Privatization of state industries
- Anti-union legislation
- Council house sales (Right to Buy)

**US (Reagan, 1981-1989)**:
- Top income tax cut from 70% to 28%
- Corporate tax cuts
- Financial deregulation
- Anti-union policies (PATCO strike 1981)

**Results**:
- Union membership decline (UK: 55% → 29%)
- Wage stagnation begins
- Inequality starts rising
- Financial sector grows dramatically
- Manufacturing declines

**The Great Divergence Begins**:
- 1979: Productivity and wages aligned
- 1980s: Gap opens
- By 2020: Productivity up 70%, wages up 12% (US data, similar UK trend)

**Example Prose**:
```
In 1979, Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister with a radical vision: 
"There is no such thing as society."

Her policies reshaped Britain:

The top tax rate was slashed from 83% to 40%. The message: wealth is good, 
accumulate as much as you can.

Unions were attacked with legislation designed to break their power. Without 
unions, workers lost their ability to bargain for fair wages.

State industries were privatized. Public housing was sold off. The commons 
were enclosed.

Financial markets were deregulated. The "Big Bang" of 1986 transformed London 
into a global financial center—and a playground for speculation.

The philosophy was simple: markets know best. Get government out of the way. 
Let wealth trickle down.

It didn't trickle.

By the mid-1980s, something unprecedented was happening. Productivity kept 
rising—workers were producing more per hour than ever. But wages flatlined.

The wealth workers created didn't disappear. It flowed up—to executives, to 
shareholders, to the already wealthy.

This was the beginning of the Great Divergence.

## The Financial Crisis (2008-2012)

### The Crisis

**Timeline**:
- **2007**: Subprime mortgage crisis begins
- **September 2008**: Lehman Brothers collapses
- **October 2008**: Bank bailouts begin
- **2009**: Recession deepens, unemployment soars

**UK Bailouts**:
- Royal Bank of Scotland: £45.5bn
- Lloyds Banking Group: £20.3bn
- Total banking sector support: ~£500bn in guarantees

**Economic Impact**:
- GDP fell 6% (2008-2009)
- Unemployment rose from 5.2% to 8.5%
- House prices fell ~20% (2007-2009)
- Stock market (FTSE 100) fell 48% peak to trough

**Example Prose**:
```
September 15, 2008. Lehman Brothers, a 158-year-old investment bank, filed 
for bankruptcy.

Within weeks, the global financial system was in freefall. Banks stopped 
lending. Stock markets crashed. Millions lost their jobs.

The banks had made reckless bets on housing. When the bubble burst, they 
faced collapse. Governments had a choice: let them fail, or bail them out.

They chose bailout.

In the UK, the government spent £65.5 billion to rescue banks. Total support, 
including guarantees, reached £500 billion.

This was necessary, we were told. The banks were "too big to fail." If they 
collapsed, the entire economy would go with them.

But here's what most people don't understand about what happened next.

The rescue wasn't just about saving banks. It was about saving asset prices. 
And that's where the real wealth transfer began.
```

### Quantitative Easing - The First Wave

**QE Programs (UK)**:
- **March 2009**: £75bn announced
- **May 2009**: Increased to £125bn
- **August 2009**: Increased to £175bn
- **November 2009**: Increased to £200bn
- **October 2011**: £75bn (QE2)
- **February 2012**: Increased to £325bn
- **July 2012**: Increased to £375bn

**How It Worked**:
1. Bank of England creates money electronically
2. Uses it to buy government bonds from financial institutions
3. Financial institutions now have cash
4. They invest in stocks, property, other assets
5. Asset prices rise

**Effects**:
- FTSE 100: Recovered from 3,500 (March 2009) to 7,000+ (2015)
- House prices: Recovered and exceeded pre-crisis levels by 2014
- Median wages: Still below 2008 levels in 2015 (real terms)
- Wealth inequality: Accelerated dramatically

**Who Benefited**:
- Top 10% own ~70% of financial assets
- Top 1% own ~23% of all wealth
- Bottom 50% own ~5% of financial assets

**Example Prose**:
```
Quantitative Easing. It sounds technical, almost boring. It was revolutionary.

Between 2009 and 2012, the Bank of England created £375 billion. Not printed—
created electronically, with a keystroke.

The stated goal: prevent deflation, stimulate the economy, help everyone.

The actual effect: the biggest wealth transfer in modern British history.

Here's the mechanism:

The Bank of England creates money. It uses that money to buy government bonds 
from banks and financial institutions. Those institutions now have cash. They 
can't just sit on it—they need returns. So they invest: stocks, property, 
corporate bonds, anything that generates yield.

Asset prices soar.

If you owned assets—a stock portfolio, rental properties, a business—you got 
much wealthier. Your wealth increased not because you did anything, but because 
the central bank inflated asset prices.

If you didn't own assets—if you lived paycheck to paycheck—you got nothing. 
Actually, worse than nothing: the inflation that followed made your wages 
worth less.

The FTSE 100 recovered within three years and soared to new heights.
Median wages? Still below 2008 levels a decade later.

This was the test run. The real experiment came in 2020.

## COVID-19 and The Great Acceleration (2020-2024)

### The Pandemic Response

**UK QE (2020-2021)**:
- **March 2020**: £200bn announced
- **June 2020**: Increased by £100bn
- **November 2020**: Increased by £150bn
- **Total COVID QE**: £450bn
- **Total QE (all time)**: £895bn

**Fiscal Support**:
- Furlough scheme: £70bn
- Business support: £80bn+
- Total fiscal response: ~£400bn

**Global Context**:
- US Federal Reserve: $5 trillion created
- European Central Bank: €1.85 trillion
- Largest monetary expansion in human history

### The Wealth Explosion

**Billionaire Wealth**:
- **UK**: Increased from ~£500bn (2020) to £684bn (2024) = +37%
- **Global**: Billionaire wealth increased 54% during pandemic
- **US**: Billionaire wealth increased $2.1 trillion (70%)

**Asset Prices (2020-2021)**:
- FTSE 100: +25% from March 2020 low
- UK house prices: +16% (2020-2022)
- S&P 500: +100% from March 2020 low
- Bitcoin: +800% (2020-2021)

**Meanwhile**:
- Real wages fell 3% (2021-2023) due to inflation
- 1 in 5 UK households in poverty
- Food bank usage tripled
- Energy crisis pushed millions into fuel poverty

**Example Prose**:
```
March 2020. The world locked down.

Millions couldn't work. Businesses couldn't operate. The economy stopped.

Governments faced a choice: let people starve, or provide support.

They chose support. Furlough schemes, business grants, direct payments. In 
the UK alone, £400 billion in fiscal support.

This was necessary. This was right.

But here's what else happened:

The Bank of England created £450 billion in 18 months. The US Federal Reserve 
created $5 trillion. The largest monetary expansion in human history.

And just like in 2008, that money flowed into assets.

Stock markets hit record highs—during a pandemic.
House prices surged—during an economic crisis.
Billionaire wealth increased by 54%—while millions lost their jobs.

Let's trace the money:

Government creates money → gives it to people (furlough, stimulus) → people 
spend it (they have to—rent, food, bills) → money flows to corporations 
(Amazon, supermarkets, landlords) → corporations owned by wealthy through 
stocks → wealthy get wealthier.

Meanwhile, all that new money chasing the same amount of goods = inflation.

Your money is worth less. But if you own assets, you're fine—asset prices 
rose faster than inflation.

If you don't own assets? You just got poorer.

The numbers are staggering:

• UK billionaire wealth increased by £184 billion during COVID
• The richest 1% captured 63% of all new wealth created since 2020
• Meanwhile, real wages fell for the first time in decades

This wasn't a side effect. This is how the system works.

## Gary's Economics - The Mechanism

### Asset Price Inflation Theory

**Core Concept**:
When wealth concentrates, wealthy people compete for limited assets, driving prices beyond the reach of ordinary people.

**The Mechanism**:
1. Wealthy have more money than they can spend
2. They must invest to preserve/grow wealth
3. They buy assets: property, stocks, land
4. Limited supply of assets
5. Competition drives prices up
6. Asset owners get wealthier (assets appreciate)
7. More money to invest → repeat

**Why It's Self-Perpetuating**:
- Wealth generates more wealth (compound returns)
- Asset appreciation outpaces wage growth
- Those without assets fall further behind
- Ladder gets pulled up

**Example Prose**:
```
Let's talk about what wealthy people do with money.

If you're living paycheck to paycheck, money is for spending. Rent, food, 
bills, maybe a little left over.

But if you're wealthy—if you have more money than you need to live—money 
becomes something else. It becomes a tool for making more money.

You can't just keep it in a bank account. Inflation will erode it. You need 
to invest. Buy assets. Things that hold value and generate returns.

Property. Stocks. Land. Bonds. Art. Anything scarce.

Now imagine there are 100 houses in a town. And 10 people with £10 million 
each, all looking to invest.

They can't all buy the same house. So they compete. They bid against each 
other. Prices rise.

Now imagine those 10 people become 20. Or 50. All with millions to invest. 
All competing for the same 100 houses.

Prices soar.

This is what's happening in the UK right now. Wealth has concentrated. The 
number of millionaires and billionaires has exploded. They all need somewhere 
to put their money.

So they buy property. Not to live in—to invest. They buy stocks. They buy 
land. They buy anything scarce.

And prices rise beyond the reach of ordinary people.

In 1970, the average house cost 3.5 times the average salary.
In 2024, it's 9.1 times.

This isn't because houses got better. It's because wealthy people are 
competing for them as investments.

And here's the cruel part: it's a feedback loop.

Wealthy people buy assets → asset prices rise → wealthy people's wealth 
increases → they have even more money to invest → they buy more assets → 
prices rise further.

It's self-perpetuating. The more wealth you have, the easier it is to get 
more wealth.

Meanwhile, if you don't own assets, you're locked out. Prices rise faster 
than you can save. The ladder gets pulled up.

This is why "trickle down" economics is a lie.

Rich people don't spend their wealth—they invest it in assets.
One inflates asset prices and locks people out.
The other would stimulate the economy.

We chose the first path. And now we're living with the consequences.

## The Human Cost

### Housing Unaffordability

**Statistics**:
- Average house price to income ratio: 9.1x (2024) vs 3.5x (1970)
- First-time buyer average age: 33 (2024) vs 23 (1960s)
- Years to save for deposit: 22 years (2024) vs 3 years (1980)
- Homeownership rate (under 35): 25% (2024) vs 60% (1990)
- Private renters spending >30% income on rent: 40%

**Regional Variation**:
- London: 14x income ratio
- South East: 11x
- North East: 5x (most affordable, but wages also lower)

**Example Prose**:
```
Let's make this concrete.

In 1980, if you wanted to buy a house, you needed to save for about 3 years 
to afford a deposit.

In 2024, it's 22 years.

Twenty-two years of saving every spare penny. No holidays. No emergencies. 
No life.

And that's if house prices don't rise faster than you save—which they do.

For millions of young people in the UK, homeownership isn't delayed. It's 
impossible.

The average first-time buyer is now 33 years old. In the 1960s, it was 23.

A decade of your life, gone. Spent renting, paying someone else's mortgage, 
unable to build wealth.

And it's getting worse. Homeownership among under-35s has collapsed from 
60% in 1990 to just 25% today.

An entire generation locked out.

This isn't because young people are lazy. It's not because they spend too 
much on avocados.

It's because the system is rigged. Because wealth concentrated. Because 
assets inflated beyond reach.

### Generational Wealth Gap

**Statistics**:
- Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) at age 35: 21% of national wealth
- Gen X (born 1965-1980) at age 35: 11% of national wealth
- Millennials (born 1981-1996) at age 35: 4.8% of national wealth
- Gen Z (born 1997+): Projected to be even lower

**Wealth by Age Group (2020)**:
- 55-64 year olds: Average wealth £1.2 million
- 25-34 year olds: Average wealth £60,000
- Ratio: 20:1

**Example Prose**:
```
Baby Boomers born in 1956 held 21% of national wealth when they were 35.

Millennials born in 1986 held 4.8% of national wealth when they were 35.

The same age. The same stage of life. But one generation has been locked out.

Not because they're lazy. Not because they don't work hard.

Because the rules changed. Because wealth concentrated. Because the ladder 
was pulled up.

The average 60-year-old in the UK has wealth of £1.2 million.
The average 30-year-old has wealth of £60,000.

A 20-to-1 ratio.

This isn't just about money. It's about life chances. Security. Freedom.

If you're born into wealth, you inherit a house deposit. You get help with 
university. You have a safety net.

If you're not, you start from zero. You rent forever. You can't save. You 
can't build wealth.

The social contract is broken.

For generations, the deal was simple: work hard, play by the rules, and 
you'll have a decent life. A home. Security. The chance to do better than 
your parents.

That deal is dead.

## Wealth Tax - The Solution

### Revenue Potential

**Estimates (UK)**:
- 1% above £10m: ~£10bn/year
- 2% above £5m: ~£25bn/year
- Progressive structure (1-3%): ~£15bn/year

**What That Could Fund**:
- NHS annual budget: £180bn (8% increase)
- Build 100,000 social homes/year: £10bn
- Free university tuition: £12bn
- Green infrastructure: £15bn

**Who Would Pay**:
- Wealth above £10m: ~0.5% of population (~350,000 people)
- Wealth above £5m: ~1% of population (~700,000 people)
- 99% would pay nothing

**Example Prose**:
```
The government is broke. Public services are crumbling. The NHS is on its 
knees.

Meanwhile, UK billionaires are worth £684 billion. The top 1% own £3.5 
trillion in wealth.

We don't have a money problem. We have a distribution problem.

A modest wealth tax—just 1% on wealth above £10 million—would raise £10-15 
billion per year.

That's enough to:
• Properly fund the NHS
• Build 100,000 social homes every year
• Make university free again
• Invest in green infrastructure

Every year. Sustainably.

And it would affect just 0.5% of people. 99.5% would pay nothing and benefit 
enormously.

This isn't radical. It's common sense.
```
