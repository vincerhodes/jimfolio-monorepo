## Section 0: Landing / Hero

### Purpose
Immediate impact. Make the visitor feel the scale of the problem viscerally.

### Visual

### Example Prose

```
THE BOTTOM 50% OF PEOPLE IN THE UK
OWN JUST 5% OF THE WEALTH

The top 10% own 57%.

This isn't normal. It wasn't always this way.
And it's getting worse.

## Section 1: The Golden Age (1945-1971)

### Purpose
Establish that shared prosperity is possible. Create contrast with today.

### Key Points
- Post-war consensus
- Bretton Woods system stability
- Wages rising with productivity
- Affordable housing
- Strong unions, worker power
- High marginal tax rates (90%+ in US, 80%+ in UK)

### Visualizations
1. **Triple line chart**: GDP, wages, productivity all rising together
2. **Animated bar chart**: Income share by quintile (more equal distribution)
3. **House price to income ratio**: Stable at 3-4x

### Example Prose

```
After World War II, something remarkable happened.

For nearly three decades, the economy grew—and everyone benefited.

When productivity increased, wages increased. When companies made more profit, 
workers earned more. When house prices rose, so did incomes.

[VISUALIZATION: Three lines moving upward together]

This wasn't luck. It was design.

The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 created a stable international monetary 
system. Currencies were pegged to the dollar, the dollar to gold. This limited 
speculation and kept money tied to real economic value.

At home, strong unions gave workers bargaining power. Top tax rates reached 
83% in the UK. The message was clear: extreme wealth concentration wouldn't 
be tolerated.

A teacher could buy a house on a single salary. A factory worker could afford 
a family home. University was free. The NHS was born.

[VISUALIZATION: House price to income ratio, stable around 3.5x]

The average house cost 3.5 times the average salary. Today, it's over 9 times.

This era proved something crucial: prosperity can be shared. Growth doesn't 
have to concentrate at the top.

But in 1971, everything changed.

## Section 2: The Turning Point (1971-1990)

### Purpose
Explain the policy shifts that broke the post-war consensus. Make it clear these were choices, not inevitabilities.

### Key Points
- Nixon ends gold standard (1971)
- What this meant for money creation
- Deregulation begins (Thatcher, Reagan)
- Union power dismantled
- Tax cuts for the wealthy
- Wages decouple from productivity

### Visualizations

2. **Timeline**: Key policy changes annotated
3. **Top tax rate decline**: Animated from 83% to 45%
4. **Union membership decline**: UK union density 1970-2024

### Example Prose

```
August 15, 1971.

President Nixon appeared on television and announced the United States would 
no longer convert dollars to gold.

[VISUALIZATION: Timeline marker, Bretton Woods system breaks]

This sounds technical. It wasn't.

For 27 years, the amount of money in the system was limited by gold reserves. 
You couldn't just print unlimited currency—it had to be backed by something real.

When that link was severed, money became... abstract. Governments and central 
banks could now create money with no physical constraint.

This wasn't necessarily bad. But it required new rules, new safeguards.

Instead, we got deregulation.

---

Throughout the 1980s, a new philosophy took hold: "The market knows best."

Unions were attacked and dismantled. In 1979, 55% of UK workers were union 
members. By 2000, it was 29%. Today, it's 23%.

[VISUALIZATION: Union membership decline]

Without unions, workers lost their bargaining power. Without bargaining power, 
wages stagnated.

Meanwhile, taxes on the wealthy were slashed. The top rate of income tax fell 
from 83% to 40%. The message had reversed: extreme wealth was now celebrated, 
not constrained.

[VISUALIZATION: Top tax rate decline]

And here's where it shows up in the data:

[VISUALIZATION: Productivity vs wages—THE GREAT DIVERGENCE]

For decades, these lines moved together. When workers produced more, they 
earned more.

Then they split.

Productivity kept rising. Wages flatlined.

The wealth workers created didn't disappear—it went somewhere. It flowed up, 
to executives, to shareholders, to the already wealthy.

This was the beginning. But the real acceleration was still to come.

## Section 3: The Financial Crisis & First QE (2008-2012)

### Purpose
Explain how the 2008 crisis response accelerated inequality through quantitative easing.

### Key Points
- Housing bubble and crash
- Bank bailouts
- Quantitative easing introduced
- Asset prices recover, wages don't
- "Rescue the economy" = rescue asset prices

### Visualizations
1. **House price crash and recovery**: V-shaped for assets, flat for wages
2. **QE timeline**: Money supply expansion
3. **Stock market vs median income**: Divergence post-2008
4. **Wealth by percentile**: Top 10% wealth shoots up post-QE

### Example Prose

```
2008. The financial system collapsed.

Banks had made reckless bets on housing. When the bubble burst, they faced 
bankruptcy. The economy was in freefall.

Governments had a choice: let the banks fail, or bail them out.

They chose bailout.

[VISUALIZATION: Bank bailout amounts]

But here's what most people don't understand about what happened next.

---

QUANTITATIVE EASING

Between 2009 and 2012, the Bank of England created £375 billion.

Not printed, exactly—created electronically. Added to the money supply with 
a keystroke.

The stated goal: prevent deflation, stimulate the economy, help everyone.

The actual effect: the biggest wealth transfer in modern history.

Here's how it worked:

[VISUALIZATION: QE money flow diagram - ANIMATED]

1. Bank of England creates money
2. Uses it to buy government bonds from financial institutions
3. Financial institutions now have cash
4. They invest it in stocks, property, other assets
5. Asset prices soar

If you owned assets—stocks, property, bonds—you got much wealthier.

If you didn't own assets—if you lived paycheck to paycheck—you got nothing. 
Actually, worse than nothing: the inflation that followed made your money 
worth less.

[VISUALIZATION: Stock market vs median wage, 2008-2012]

The FTSE 100 recovered within 3 years and then soared to new heights.

Median wages? Still below 2008 levels a decade later.

---

Here's the cruel logic:

QE was sold as helping "the economy." But "the economy" and "most people" 
aren't the same thing.

When central banks say they're "supporting the economy," they mean supporting 
asset prices. And assets are owned overwhelmingly by the wealthy.

[VISUALIZATION: Asset ownership by wealth percentile]

The top 10% own 70% of all financial assets.
The bottom 50% own 5%.

So when you "support asset prices," you're supporting the wealth of the 
already wealthy.

This was the test run. The real experiment came in 2020.
```

### Scroll Transition

## Section 4: COVID & The Great Acceleration (2020-2024)

### Purpose
Show how COVID response turbocharged inequality. Make the mechanism crystal clear.

### Key Points
- Unprecedented money printing
- £450bn QE in UK, $5tn in US
- Lockdown → government support → money flows to corporations
- Asset prices explode
- Billionaire wealth surges
- Working people face inflation

### Visualizations
1. **Money supply chart**: Vertical spike in 2020
2. **Billionaire wealth increase**: Shocking numbers
3. **House prices vs wages**: Gap becomes chasm
4. **Inflation impact**: Real wage decline

### Example Prose

```
March 2020. The world locked down.

The economy stopped. Millions couldn't work. Businesses couldn't operate.

Governments faced a choice: let people starve, or provide support.

They chose support. Furlough schemes, business grants, direct payments.

This was necessary. This was right.

But here's what else happened:

[VISUALIZATION: Money supply explosion]

The Bank of England created £450 billion in 18 months.

The US Federal Reserve created $5 trillion.

The largest monetary expansion in human history.

---

Now, remember what we learned about QE:

Created money → financial institutions → asset purchases → asset prices soar

It happened again. But faster. Bigger. More extreme.

[VISUALIZATION: Asset price explosion 2020-2021]

Stock markets hit record highs—during a pandemic.
House prices surged—during an economic crisis.
Billionaire wealth increased by 54%—while millions lost their jobs.

Let's trace the money:

[VISUALIZATION: Animated money flow - COVID edition]

1. Government creates money
2. Gives it to people (furlough, grants, stimulus)
3. People spend it (they have to—they need food, rent, bills)
4. Money flows to corporations (Amazon, supermarkets, landlords)
5. Corporations owned by the wealthy through stocks
6. Wealthy get wealthier

Meanwhile, all that new money chasing the same amount of goods = inflation.

[VISUALIZATION: Inflation chart 2020-2024]

Your money is worth less. But if you own assets, you're fine—asset prices 
rose faster than inflation.

If you don't own assets? You just got poorer.

---

The numbers are staggering:

• UK billionaire wealth increased by £150 billion during COVID
• The richest 1% captured 63% of all new wealth created since 2020
• Meanwhile, 1 in 5 UK households now live in poverty

[VISUALIZATION: Wealth concentration animation - wealth flowing upward]

This wasn't a side effect. This is how the system works.

And once you understand the mechanism, you can't unsee it.

## Section 5: How The Machine Works (Educational)

### Purpose
Explain Gary's Economics concepts simply. Make people understand the mechanism of wealth concentration.

### Key Points
- Asset competition mechanism
- Why wealthy people buy assets
- How this drives prices up
- Feedback loop of wealth concentration
- Why "trickle down" doesn't work

### Visualizations
1. **Asset competition diagram**: Animated musical chairs metaphor
2. **The feedback loop**: Circular diagram
3. **Wealth multiplier effect**: How £1m becomes £2m becomes £4m
4. **Trickle down vs reality**: Side-by-side comparison

### Example Prose

```
Let's talk about what wealthy people do with money.

If you're living paycheck to paycheck, money is for spending. Food, rent, 
bills, maybe a little left over.

But if you're wealthy—if you have more money than you need to live—money 
becomes something else.

It becomes a tool for making more money.

---

THE ASSET COMPETITION MECHANISM

Imagine there are 100 houses in a town.

Now imagine 10 people have £10 million each, and they're all looking to 
invest it.

They can't just keep it in a bank account—inflation will erode it. They 
need to buy assets: property, stocks, land, anything that holds value.

[VISUALIZATION: Animated diagram - wealthy figures competing for limited houses]

But there are only so many assets. Only 100 houses.

So they compete. They bid against each other. Prices rise.

Now imagine those 10 people become 20 people. Or 50. All with millions to 
invest. All competing for the same 100 houses.

Prices soar.

This is what's happening in the UK right now.

[VISUALIZATION: House price to income ratio, 1970 vs 2024]

In 1970, the average house cost 3.5x the average salary.
In 2024, it's 9.1x.

This isn't because houses got better. It's because wealthy people are 
competing for them as investments.

---

THE FEEDBACK LOOP

Here's where it gets worse:

[VISUALIZATION: Circular diagram showing the loop]

1. Wealthy people buy assets
2. Asset prices rise
3. Wealthy people's wealth increases (they own the assets)
4. They have even more money to invest
5. They buy more assets
6. Prices rise further
7. Return to step 3

It's self-perpetuating.

The more wealth you have, the easier it is to get more wealth.

Meanwhile, if you don't own assets, you're locked out. Prices rise faster 
than you can save. The ladder gets pulled up.

---

"BUT DOESN'T WEALTH TRICKLE DOWN?"

This is the most successful lie in modern economics.

The theory: If rich people get richer, they'll spend more, creating jobs 
and prosperity for everyone.

The reality: Rich people don't spend their wealth—they invest it in assets.

[VISUALIZATION: Trickle down theory vs reality]

THEORY: £1m to billionaire → they spend it → jobs created → prosperity

REALITY: £1m to billionaire → they buy stocks/property → asset prices rise 
→ they get richer → everyone else priced out

When you give money to poor people, they spend it (they have to).
When you give money to rich people, they buy assets.

One stimulates the economy. The other inflates asset prices.

---

This is why QE makes inequality worse.
This is why house prices are unaffordable.
This is why billionaires got richer during COVID.

It's not a bug. It's how the system works.

But it doesn't have to be this way.

## Section 6: The Human Cost

### Purpose
Make it personal. Show real-world impacts. Build emotional connection.

### Key Points

- Generational wealth gap
- Social mobility collapse
- Mental health impacts
- Democratic implications

### Visualizations
1. **Years to save for house deposit**: 1980 vs 2024
2. **Generational wealth comparison**: Boomers vs Millennials vs Gen Z
3. **Social mobility index**: UK ranking decline
4. **Map**: Regional inequality in UK

### Example Prose

```
Let's make this concrete.

In 1980, the average first-time buyer needed to save for 3 years to afford 
a house deposit.

In 2024, it's 22 years.

[VISUALIZATION: Years to save comparison]

Twenty-two years of saving every spare penny. No holidays, no emergencies, 
no life.

And that's if house prices don't rise faster than you save—which they do.

For millions of young people in the UK, homeownership isn't delayed. It's 
impossible.

---

This isn't just about houses.

[VISUALIZATION: Generational wealth comparison]

Baby Boomers born in 1956 held 21% of national wealth when they were 35.

Millennials born in 1986 held 4.8% of national wealth when they were 35.

The same age, the same stage of life—but one generation has been locked out.

Not because they're lazy. Not because they spend too much on avocados.

Because the rules changed. Because wealth concentrated. Because assets 
inflated beyond reach.

---

THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS BROKEN

For generations, the deal was simple: work hard, play by the rules, and 
you'll have a decent life. A home. Security. The chance to do better than 
your parents.

That deal is dead.

[VISUALIZATION: Social mobility index - UK decline]

The UK has fallen to 21st in the world for social mobility.

If you're born poor in Britain today, you're likely to stay poor.

Not because of lack of talent or effort. Because wealth is inherited, not 
earned. Because the system is rigged to keep wealth where it is.

---

And it's getting worse.

Every year, the gap widens. Every crisis, the wealthy get wealthier.

If we do nothing, in 20 years:

• The top 1% will own over 30% of all wealth
• Homeownership will be a luxury for the rich
• An entire generation will rent forever from wealthy landlords
• Social mobility will be a memory
• Democracy itself will be threatened (wealth = political power)

[VISUALIZATION: Projection chart - "If we do nothing"]

This is the path we're on.

But there's another path.

- Who it would affect (very few people)
- Why it's fair
- International examples

### Example Prose

```
Here's the simple truth:

The government is broke. Public services are crumbling. The NHS is on its 
knees. Schools are falling apart.

Meanwhile, UK billionaires are worth £684 billion.

The top 1% own £3.5 trillion in wealth.

We don't have a money problem. We have a distribution problem.

---

WHAT IS A WEALTH TAX?

It's simple: an annual tax on total wealth above a certain threshold.

Not income. Wealth. The total value of everything you own: property, stocks, 
savings, assets.

Here's what a fair wealth tax could look like:

[VISUALIZATION: Wealth tax brackets]

• £0 - £10 million: 0% (99.5% of people pay nothing)
• £10m - £50m: 1% annually
• £50m - £100m: 2% annually  
• £100m+: 3% annually

If you have £5 million in wealth, you pay nothing.
If you have £20 million, you pay £100,000/year (1% of £10m).
If you have £200 million, you pay £4 million/year.

---

HOW MUCH WOULD IT RAISE?

[VISUALIZATION: Revenue projection]

A modest wealth tax on wealth above £10 million would raise approximately 
£10-15 billion per year.

A more progressive tax on wealth above £5 million could raise £25-30 billion.

That's enough to:
• Properly fund the NHS
• Build 100,000 social homes per year
• Make university free again
• Invest in green infrastructure
• Reduce the deficit

Every year.

---

"BUT WON'T THE RICH JUST LEAVE?"

This is the most common objection. Let's look at the evidence.

[VISUALIZATION: Migration data from wealth tax countries]

Norway has had a wealth tax since 1892. 
Switzerland has had one for decades.
Spain reintroduced theirs in 2011.

Did the rich flee?

Some left. Most stayed. And the countries are doing fine.

Why? Because:

1. Moving countries is hard (family, language, culture, business ties)
2. Most wealth is in non-mobile assets (property, businesses)
3. Exit taxes can be imposed on those who leave
4. The benefits of living in a functioning society outweigh the tax

Norway's wealth tax raises 1% of GDP. Their economy is thriving. Their 
billionaires are still there.

---

"BUT IT'S TOO COMPLICATED TO IMPLEMENT"

Is it though?

We already value property for council tax.
We already track financial assets for capital gains tax.
We already have inheritance tax (which is far more complex).

Yes, it requires administrative capacity. Yes, there are challenges.

But we're talking about taxing 0.5% of the population. The wealthiest 0.5%.

If we can track benefits for millions of poor people down to the penny, we 
can track assets for a few thousand rich people.

The question isn't "Can we do it?"

The question is "Do we have the political will?"

---

"BUT ISN'T IT UNFAIR TO TAX WEALTH?"

Let's talk about fairness.

Is it fair that nurses pay 40% tax on overtime while billionaires pay 
nothing on wealth growth?

Is it fair that someone working full-time can't afford rent while landlords 
accumulate millions in property wealth?

Is it fair that the bottom 50% own 5% of wealth while the top 1% own 23%?

Wealth isn't earned in isolation. It's built on:
• Public infrastructure
• Educated workers
• Legal systems
• Stable society
• Healthcare
• Research funded by taxpayers

If society enabled your wealth, society deserves a share.

Especially when that society is crumbling from lack of funding.

NORWAY: 132 YEARS OF WEALTH TAX

Norway introduced a wealth tax in 1892. It's still there.

[VISUALIZATION: Norway wealth tax details]

• Rate: 0.95% on wealth above ~£150,000
• Revenue: ~1% of GDP (£4-5 billion equivalent for UK)
• Result: One of the most equal societies in the developed world

Did their billionaires leave? Some did. Most didn't.

Did their economy collapse? No. Norway has one of the highest GDP per capita 
in the world.

Did inequality disappear? No. But it's far lower than the UK.

The wealth tax is part of a broader social contract: high taxes, excellent 
public services, shared prosperity.

And Norwegians are among the happiest people on Earth.

SWITZERLAND: WEALTH TAX IN THE WORLD'S BANKING CAPITAL

If anywhere should have lost its rich to wealth tax, it's Switzerland.

Yet most Swiss cantons have wealth taxes. And Switzerland remains a haven 
for the wealthy.

[VISUALIZATION: Swiss wealth tax map]

Why? Because wealth tax is part of the deal:

• Low income taxes
• Excellent infrastructure  
• Political stability
• High quality of life
• Functioning public services

The rich stay because the overall package is attractive. The wealth tax 
funds the society that makes Switzerland desirable.

It's proof that wealth tax doesn't kill competitiveness. It can enhance it.

---

SPAIN: REINTRODUCTION AFTER CRISIS

Spain abolished its wealth tax in 2008 (bad timing).

After the financial crisis devastated public finances, they brought it back 
in 2011.

[VISUALIZATION: Spain wealth tax timeline]

• Temporary measure that became permanent
• Applies to wealth above €700,000
• Raises ~€1.5 billion per year
• Minimal capital flight

The lesson: even after abolishing it, they realized they needed it.

When crisis hits, when public services need funding, wealth tax is one of 
the few tools that works.

WHAT THESE COUNTRIES TEACH US

1. **Wealth tax is viable**: Three different countries, different systems, 
   all making it work

2. **The rich don't flee en masse**: Some leave, most stay, life goes on

3. **It raises real revenue**: Billions per year, sustainably

4. **It's part of a social contract**: High taxes + good services = 
   functioning society

5. **It can be designed well**: Different rates, thresholds, exemptions—
   it's flexible

The UK is one of the most unequal developed countries.
We have some of the wealthiest billionaires in the world.
Our public services are crumbling.

We have the wealth. We have the need. We have the examples.

by billionaires.

The other path leads to a fairer society. Where wealth is shared. Where 
everyone has a chance. Where public services work. Where the next generation 
can thrive.

IF WE DO NOTHING

• By 2045, the top 1% will own 30%+ of all wealth
• Homeownership rate will fall below 50%
• NHS waiting lists will double
• Social mobility will continue to decline
• Political power will concentrate with the wealthy
• Climate crisis will worsen (the rich emit 100x more carbon)

This isn't speculation. It's the trajectory we're on.

---

IF WE ACT

A wealth tax of just 2% on wealth above £10 million would:

[VISUALIZATION: Interactive calculator]

• Raise £15 billion per year
• Build 100,000 social homes annually
• Hire 300,000 more NHS staff
• Make university free
• Fund green transition
• Reduce inequality

And it would affect just 0.5% of people.

99.5% of us would pay nothing and benefit enormously.

The wealthy didn't get rich alone. They got rich in a society built by all 
of us.

Roads we paid for. Schools we funded. Legal systems we maintain. Workers we 
educated. Stability we provide.

It's not radical to ask them to contribute fairly.

What's radical is allowing 1% of people to own 23% of everything while 
millions struggle to eat.

- **Sections**: 9 major sections
- **Subsections**: 30-40 scroll-triggered moments

This is long-form, but the interactivity and visualizations will keep 
engagement high. Each section should feel like a revelation, building 
momentum toward action.
