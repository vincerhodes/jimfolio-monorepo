# Branding

## Primary name (recommended)

**DeliveryLens**

- Rationale: emphasizes transparency and decision-grade visibility for service delivery leadership.
- Avoids similarity to any real product naming.

## Tagline

**"Make delivery visible."**

## Visual direction

- Dark, modern, high-contrast UI (consistent with Jimfolio aesthetics)
- Accent color: teal/emerald for "healthy"; amber/red for risk
- Strong information hierarchy: dashboards should look like an operational cockpit

## Copy + IP safety

- Do not reference real customers, provider names, contracts, or proprietary terminology.
- Use synthetic providers (e.g., "Northlink", "BlueWave", "OrbitTel").
- Include a footer note inside the app: "Fictional showcase. Data is synthetic."
